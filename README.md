Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices in Bengaluru using a linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various attributes like location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

location: The location of the house.
size: The size of the house in BHK (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).
total_sqft: The total area of the house in square feet.
bath: The number of bathrooms.
price: The price of the house (target variable).
Environment
Python 3.9.13
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Installation
To set up the environment, install the necessary libraries using pip.

Usage
Clone the repository.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
Code Explanation
Data Loading and Preprocessing
The project starts by loading the dataset and performing data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting relevant columns to numerical types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is conducted to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. This includes visualizing the data to gain insights into patterns and correlations.

Feature Engineering
New features are created, and categorical variables are converted into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding. The data is also normalized to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

Model Training
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is then trained on the training set to predict house prices.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These metrics help in assessing the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Inference
The trained model is used to make predictions on new data, providing estimated house prices based on the input features.

Strengths of Techniques Used
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensures high-quality data for training, which is crucial for model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Helps in understanding the data and identifying key features influencing house prices.
Feature Engineering: Transforms raw data into meaningful features, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
Linear Regression Model: A simple yet powerful model for regression tasks, offering interpretable results.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy and performance.
